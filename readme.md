Implentation ReadMe

Beginning steps, undesrtand how grid.cpp works as mentioned in assignment page

- Begin implenting button to start connect 4 with Imgui Page
- Display a 6x7 of squares acting as the board. (might want to change the color somehow)

- Implement a 2 player and be able to fully play a game.

- Trouble: when placing piece is should go all the way down to the lowest square possible.

-Implelment the win condition for connect 4

-Implement AI

-Extra: animate drop down piece.

Beginning: I was able to implement a board as a 6x7.

Players are now able to implement a piece but currently not falling
